# PredictiveRiceYieldModel
I led a team of 4 as an enabler to emerge as global winners in the EY Open Data Science Competition to address food-security constraints faced by low-income countries. Our innovative project delivers an easy-to-use predictive rice yield model that requires minimal processing time and power, making it accessible to end-users with limited bandwidth and technical resources. We effectively captured crucial insights to understand crop growth and facilitate informed decision-making by analysing large unstructured datasets and developing short and long-term food security strategies. Our technology will be utilized by farmers, NGOâ€™s, private organizations to optimize resource allocation, maximize harvest yields, improve food availability, and is effortlessly scalable.
